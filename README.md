# Water Footprint App

## Overview

The Water Footprint App is designed to provide detailed information about the water footprint of various goods and services. By using digital technologies like machine learning,natural language processing this app aims to educate users about the amount of water used to produce everyday items, promoting more efficient and responsible water usage.

## Purpose

The water footprint measures the amount of water used to produce each of the goods and services we use. Understanding our water footprint helps us recognize how limited freshwater resources are being consumed and polluted. The impact of water usage varies depending on the source and availability of water, with significant consequences in water-scarce regions. By providing readily available data on water footprints, this app aims to raise awareness and encourage more efficient water use to prevent severe droughts and promote sustainability.

## Features

- **Barcode Scanning**: Users can scan the barcode of a product to instantly fetch its water footprint details.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use app with support for local languages to ensure accessibility across India.
- **Employee Login**: Authorized company employees can log in to manage product information and upload details by scanning product barcodes.
- **Water Footprint Data**: Comprehensive data on the water footprint of various products, helping users make informed decisions.
